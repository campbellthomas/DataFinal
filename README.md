# Classifying Dog Breed Groups 
## Description 
This is a project that classifies dogs into their "breed groups" (mixed breed, working, hound, companion, herding, terrier, sporting, and hybrid) based on various ordinal and continuous characteristics. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, originally used to classify dogs by how well they might adaprt to living in an apartment. 
This project went through all the phases of developing a ML model inlcuding exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, splitting, ML model selection, tuning, and training, and interpretation/analysis. 
This project trains 4 models to accomplish this task: LogisticRegression, RandomForest, SupportVectorMachine, and XGBoost.

## Files 
* This project contains the datasets in csv format in the data folder. There are training and testing sets from Kaggle in the subfolder 'data'. The preprocessed sets are also in this folder as csv files named X_test, X_train, X_val, y_test, y_train, y_val.   
* The figures are all saved as png and html files in the figures folder.
* The results of my models are in the results folder.
* The written report on my project, models, and analysis is in the report folder.
* The code for my project is in the src folder.
There is a LICENSE folder to explain usage rights.
